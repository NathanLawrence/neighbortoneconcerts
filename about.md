# Our Mission

Neighbor Tone Concerts aims to create a more personal musical experience by enabling concerts and performances in the most comfortable, intimate setting – a home. We hope to foster a more vibrant and inclusive community where people feel loved and supported by one another and everyone is united by a deep love of music.

# Why Neighbor Tone Concerts?

If you’re anything like us, you feel a little disconnected. Disconnected from your neighbors, your community, and you feel like there’s not really much you can do about it. If only there was some common ground or unifying activity that could make you feel more included in your community, and what better way to feel connected than through music? That’s why we started Neighbor Tone Concerts—to enable that connection with your community through music, within the coziness and comfort of your own home.
